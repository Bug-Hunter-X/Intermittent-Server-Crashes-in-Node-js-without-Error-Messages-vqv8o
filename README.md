# Intermittent Server Crashes in Node.js

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle issue in Node.js applications: intermittent server crashes without any apparent error messages in the console.  The problem is particularly challenging to debug because it lacks obvious clues.

## Problem Description

A seemingly simple Node.js HTTP server occasionally crashes without providing any error details. This makes identifying and resolving the root cause significantly difficult.

## Solution

The solution involves implementing robust error handling and using appropriate logging mechanisms.  This helps catch unexpected exceptions and provide essential diagnostic information for debugging.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `node server.js`.
3. Observe the server behavior.  The server may run for a while without issue, then unexpectedly terminate without a clear indication of why.
